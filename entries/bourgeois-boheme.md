fair and vegan shoes, produced in Europe. Bourgeois Boheme uses no leather or animal products, no nasty glues or dyes – in fact, nothing that’s harmful to anyone, whether they have four legs or two. 
The founder of Bourgeois Boheme makes it her business to visit all factories personally to meet the teams of craftsmen and women who are responsible for making each pair of BoBos.
