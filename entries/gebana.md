"We enable our customers to shop worldwide directly from the farm. This means a delivery of our products as directly as possible from the farmer to your home. The packaging is kept original. Logistics and delivery date should match the product, not the other way around. The consequent realisation of this concept respects the environment and optimises the conditions for producers as well as for consumers. With its commitment and its direct contacts with the producers as supplier of organic and FLO (fair trade certified) raw goods, gebana already made a name for itself. We invest in the processing and quality control on site and make contracts directly with the farmer families. Our product range includes dry fruit, nuts, soy and soy derivatives, cocoa and sugar."
