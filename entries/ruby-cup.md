"Menstrual cups are the modern feminine hygiene solution, and are a healthy and sustainable alternative to pads and tampons. Ruby Cup is a healthy, high-quality and eco-friendly menstrual cup made from 100% medical grade silicone, and reusable for up to 10 years.

Have you ever thought about what you would do without menstrual products? How do girls and women who cannot afford pads or tampons cope with their period? They are forced to use whatever they have at hand such as bark, mud, newspaper, cloth, and even pieces of mattress. When given a Ruby Cup, girls can go all the way through primary school, secondary school and college without having to worry about their menstruation. For every purchase in our shop, we donate and distribute a Ruby Cup to a schoolgirl in a developing country who cannot afford her own sanitary products. With a cup she can enjoy freedom, confidence and education without having to worry about her period."
