TWOTHIRDS is setting an example to the industry by being the first clothing brand to replace its polyester bags with a packaging that will completely biodegrade into naturally occurring substances and produce no harmful residues. They promote the use of Organic Cotton because simply put, less pesticides end up in the ground and hence in our oceans. Additionally they are trying to minimize the impact of any kind of fabric treatment. Using chlorine free merino wool, veg tan leather, untreated garments or simply, by limiting the amounts of colors.
