Veja produces organic footwear and bags under fair conditions. The fabrication costs are 3 to 4 times higher than other footwear brands because the trainers and bags are produced with dignity. But Veja’s “no advertising” policy makes it possible to sell trainers at a price which is equal to competitors.

The honesty and self-reflection of Veja is admiring. It says on the website that "the Veja project is far from perfect. It can be examined on many levels to reveal many limitations." Upon that it lists and explains detailed the issues they are still facing and try to eliminate.
