**CLOSED**

The store name could be translated as "it would be better if it would already be good". And *making the world a better place* can be seen as the vision of the two founders who just opened a store for sustainable design and living. However, if you have no time to stop by when visiting Berlin, you can order all items also online: do it yourself products, furniture, lamps, bags, toys, books and other accessories. Most of them are either fair, organic, recycled or even all of it.

The website is all German but nevertheless it is easy to browse your favourite items.*
