"Here at Globe Hope we live by our three key values: aesthetics, ecology and ethics. We are committed both in our design and production to the principles of sustainable development and want to offer consumers an ecological alternative and to encourage people to think about their environment. Our clothes, bags and accessories save and reuse the limited resources on earth and their production is ethical. While weâ€™re not ready to compromise our ecological values, creating interesting, beautiful and practical products is the most fundamental driver for our design team."
