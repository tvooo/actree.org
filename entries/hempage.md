hempAge works according to the 'do no harm' principle. Their wish is to produce sustainable clothes. Most of them are at least partly made out of hemp, which is a very strong fibre. 

You cannot buy them directly online at their website but they list some webshops in France on their website, where you can get hempAge. In Germany many 'Weltl√§den' have their products: (link: http://www.hempage.de/ text: German website)
