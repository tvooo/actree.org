"Monkee Genes was born in 2006 out of the frustration of the denim market, to offer something fresh vibrant and youthful. Disillusioned with Primark and disposable high street fashion, the Monkee Genes team decided to raise public consciousness.

Monkee Genes is the first and only jeans label to have unique mix of astute acreditations from The Soil Association and the Global Organic Textile Standards (GOTS) 

Innovative fits and styles in top of the range fabrics, classic denim with a retro twist and luscious sateen cottons in pop art inspired colours.

In todays fragile environment Monkee Genes is the independant label to watch, on trend, affordable and with an eco and ethical conscience." *http://www.monkeegenes.com/auxpage_manifesto/*
