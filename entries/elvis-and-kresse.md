Elvis & Kresse design and manufacture amazing handbags, purses, accessories and other home & living objects out of old fire hoses and other recycled materials.

"We build as much value as we can into each piece and style them for use beyond single seasons. All Elvis & Kresse products are hand-made and unique.

It would never be enough to give an old fire hose a somewhat useful life, we must transform it, make it desirable or useful in and of itself; something you would want even if it were not recycled, even without the ethics."
