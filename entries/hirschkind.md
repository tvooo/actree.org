Hirschkind is a small organic and fair trade label from Berlin. All t-shirts, bed linen, skirts, dish towels, bags are printed by hand with a special screen printing technique. The two founders of Hirschkind started with printing their first t-shirts in the kitchen and selling them on markets. Later an online shop was opened and today they already have two small shops in Berlin with other organic and fair trade articles ((link: http://www.supermarche-berlin.de/ text: supermarch√©)).

Don't panic, it's organic!
