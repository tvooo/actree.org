fairphone is one, single, open, high-performance smartphone made as fairly as possible with a transparent supply chain. One step at a time. The fairphone is therefor not completely fair but an important step to more responsibility in technology.

It tries to include conflict-free resources like tin and tantalum, concerns about workers welfare and fair working conditions, takes part in e-waste programs and has an open and flexible design. On top of that the small start up tries to be as transparent as possible with everything concerning their supply chain and resources.
