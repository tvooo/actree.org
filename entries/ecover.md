Ecover try to balance cleaning power & environmental responsibility. Even though the products are highly effective, they are not based on harsh chemicals. 

"Since 1980, Ecover has been working hard to develop and produce effective and ecological washing and cleaning agents made from vegetable-based ingredients and minerals. We do not test our products on animals and attempt that the ingredients in their products are not animal-tested by any party within the supply chain."
