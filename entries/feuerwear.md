All the products are made of used, culled fire hose that has saved many lives in active duty with the fire brigade. Every laptop bag, every shoulder bag and every belt is individually photographed. That way, you get the exact item you have placed in your shopping cart. All of the production in Europe is done in small family-run shops with fair working conditions and wages.
