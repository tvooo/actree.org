"Many people don't think about how their clothes are made. But, just as food doesn't come from a grocery store, clothes don't come from a department store. In fact, your clothing and food often start out in the same place: a farmer's field. PACT goes to great lengths to make sure our entire supply chain, from the growing and harvesting of the organic cotton to the final sewing and all the processes in between, are as clean and responsible as possible. We are pretty proud of how we make our stuff so you can not only feel good in your PACT clothes but feel good about where they came from too."
