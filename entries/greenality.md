Greenality is both, a small label for organic and fair clothes, and a (online) market place for other brands with the same vision. Greenality was founded in 2008 to change the world to better place but because they didn't want to accomplish this mission naked - they started with a T-shirt: fair, organic and without any genetically modified materials.
