Kuyichi claims, that it was first to introduce socially-responsible organic cotton jeans wear and lead the way in creating sustainable fashion from recycled cotton, recycled plastic bottles and alternative materials such as hemp and tencel.

Kuyichi is constantly working to clean up its production process and increase its use of sustainable materials. Above that, Kuyichi commits itself to work towards improving labour conditions in factories and further throughout its supply chain.
