It is not a matter of fact that producers are paid enough for their work or products to live a life in dignity. Through free trade the price pressure is so high that many small producers can barely live from their sales.

The 'Weltläden' in Germany are a true alternative. They offer a wide range of attractive products which contribute to secure the existence of small producers all over the world. All sold products are fairtrade and most of them are also from organic origin. They want to show that the idea of a sustainable development is possible and the livelihood of future generations can be sustained - not only in world politics but also on the breakfast table.
