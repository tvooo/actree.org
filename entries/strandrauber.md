Strandräuber offers organic beer mixed with cherry, lemon, quince or sallow thorn. It completely abstains from food colerants, artificial flavours and sweeteners, preservatives and stabilizers. 

It is produced in Stralsund by a small privat brewery with a long family tradition.
You can order their beer online.
