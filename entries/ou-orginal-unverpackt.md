Waste is one of the biggest problems today! The 'orginal unverpackt' supermarket offers the possibility of completely waste-free shopping.  They have more than 400 products and you can bring your own containers or buy them on the spot. They try to eliminate waste also within the supply chain by buying as directly as possible from the producers.

Their first store is located in Berlin - but we are sure, many other stores will follow.
