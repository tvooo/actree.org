"You are looking for smart and sincere children’s fashion? Jackets, trousers, shirts and dresses that are ideal for climbing, fishing, running or scuffling? Fashion for perky ladies, real gentlemen and loveable snotty brats?

Then CharLe is where you’re meant to be. We offer organic children’s fashion for boys and girls from one to eight years that offers you just that. [...]

Our collection is environmentally friendly and uses only organic raw materials and recycled materials according to the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS). To keep transportation short we produce only in Berlin and Saxony and at the same time support local jobs."

You can order CharLe clothes via other online shops listed on the webpage.
