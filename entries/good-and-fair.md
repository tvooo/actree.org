"At Good & Fair Clothing we are dedicated to producing our clothing line through a supply chain which treats people with dignity and respect. We use fair trade certified factories and organic cotton. We ensure fair wages for cotton farmers and garment workers internationally, as well as provide resources for those fighting to get out of poverty within our own community. Operating this way is challenging for sure, but we believe it's work worth doing.

Our clothing and accessories are all produced in India with a supply chain certified fair trade from farm to factory. Starting with cooperative farmers who grow organic cotton and ending with our fair trade factory partner who employs lock-stitchers at a proper wage, in a safe environment, with worker rights fully intact."
