Pants to poverty is an English company selling and producing fair and organic underwear.

Their pants sell in over 20 countries around the world and support over 5000 farmers in India.
In England, Pants are not trousers, but they are underwear. However, more than that, if something is pants, then that means it’s terrible! So, “Pants to Poverty” means Poverty is terrible, as well as saying that they are fairtrade and organic underpants!
