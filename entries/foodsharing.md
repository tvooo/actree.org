Roadtrip ahead - but still plenty of food in the fridge? 
In Germany alone, more than 82kg of food per Person are thrown away. That sums up to round about 235 Euro per Person. Not to mention bakeries, farmers, canteens and many other organisations that are sometimes forced to destroy food. 
Foodsharing ist the perfect way to share you own food  and also to benefit from saving huge amounts of groceries. 

You can start by registering on the website or just have a look - some groups organize the food sharing through a 'food sharing facebook group'. Have a look :-)
