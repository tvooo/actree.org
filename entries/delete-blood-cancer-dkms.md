Have you ever dreamed of being a hero? Saving a life might be easier than you expect. Register for the DKMS and become a potential bone marrow donor. 
Every four minutes someone is diagnosed with blood cancer, many die because they don't find a match - together with your help, we can delete blood cancer!

"DKMS, the German Bone Marrow Donor Center, belongs to a network of organizations under the umbrella of the DKMS Foundation for Giving Life.
