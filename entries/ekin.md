"Our shoes are made in a small factory near to the city of Porto in Portugal. A country (which we're proud to say) derives over 70% of its energy from renewable sources, the highest in Europe. They employ 70 local workers and are committed to high standards of ethical manufacturing. The factory has a strict non-toxic policy and they recycle nearly all their waste products, including fabric off-cuts and water. 

* production is based in Portugal
* reasonable work shifts
* no child or forced labor
* non-discriminatory work environments
* safe and hygienic work environments
* controlled employment relationship

We use Environmentally Conscious Materials
* all products are handmade in Portugal
* vegetable & chrome free tanned leathers from Portugal
* we try to source our materials locally in the region of Porto whenever possible
* soles and laces made from all-natural materials
* organic cotton/ organic cork
* vegan products as recycled and breathable artificial leathers*
* boxes made from recycled materials
* transportation: short distances and carbon-neutral"
