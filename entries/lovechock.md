"Lovechock is lovingly made by hand from the best organic, raw cacao from Ecuador. Instead of being roasted, the beans are cold ground. Lovechock's carefully selected cacao suppliers work directly with small farmers, without any middle men. In this way we can guarantee that each of the farmers involved receives a fair wage and is treated respectfully. Lovechock pays well above market prices to ensure that farmers are fairly rewarded for their hard work. "

You can buy them in different shops in many European countries:
