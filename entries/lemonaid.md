Fresh juice and fair-trade - defining characteristics of pure lemonade. All of Lemonaid's products are made from naturally sourced organic ingredients procured exclusively from certified fair-trade cooperatives.

Nevertheless the goals reach far beyond producing a refreshing fair-trade drink. Lemonaid was established to, in their own little way, make a difference. Their commitment to social business transcends the basic fair-trade label. 100% of all their profits go towards a charity.
