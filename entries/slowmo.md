"**organic is not a fashion. it is a commitment.**
slowmo products are 100% certified organic and fair traded. They are free of child labor, exploitation, genetic engineering and environmental pollution. The production is carried out in Germany. Treating men and nature with respect is the foundation.

slowmo has a clean style with extraordinary and detail-loving patterns and premium materials and manufacturing. In the fast pace of our time, we focus on calmness and durability.

slowmo is a family-run business, which was started in Berlin-Friedrichshain in 2006 by sister and brother Felicia and Melchior Moss. Urban charme and nature combine in slowmo designs."
