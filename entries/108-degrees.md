"108 Degrees is authentic, high quality streetwear that has been produced environmentally friendly and under fair conditions. This means:
* 100% certified organic products, certified by the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS),
* screenprint with water-based colors, also GOTS certified 
* production under fair conditions, certified by the Fair Wear Foundation or FLO-CERT (Fairtrade)
* reduced CO2 emissions, certified by Carbon Trust.

Though we are doing even more: 10% of our yearly corporate profits are donated to NGOs in environmental conservation (especially reforestation and protection of rain forests), animal protection and development aid."

The online shop is only accessable in German, however, they ship to Europe.
