If you bring your own lunch in reusable containers to work or school, you have already taken a big step into the right direction. But PlanetBox food containers are not only reusable - they are also made of stainless steel, which means you will probably never, ever have to throw them away. Plastic containers get *ewww* after a while of use, especially if you tend to forget to clean them for a while... no problem with PlanetBox! They also come in different configurations, so no matter how hungry you are and how many compartments you need, PlanetBox has you covered.
