"We want to educate and help people connect the dots between condoms and hunger, health care, poverty, and climate change. We hope to inspire people to make the world a better place. We’re all about responsibility—not just personal, but corporate. We want the world to be better off than it was before our condoms, which is why 10 percent of our profits support women’s reproductive health care. All that and recycled packaging, too! [...]

It’s critical for us that we operate our business with the highest level of responsibility, and we have designed Sustain to address the entire system in which it operates. Whether the issue is social equity, climate change, poverty, water pollution, population growth or Fair Trade, Sustain aspires to operate as a model for how a business can have a positive impact in every area it touches. We see ourselves as a disruptive force in the reproductive health care industry, helping it move toward better products and increased transparency—all with a focus on common good. We’d love to be a symbol for rising global standards of what is expected of business."
