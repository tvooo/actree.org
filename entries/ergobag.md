ergobag sells school bags ergonomically designed for kindergarten kids up to college students. All fabrics consist of old PET-bottles:
"Millions of old PET-bottles pollute the landscape and the sea worldwide and endanger flora and fauna. ergobag processes these very bottles to manufacture backpack fabrics. In 2012 we found a new purpose for 2.53 million bottles. The CyclePET materials we use are made from 100% post-consumer recycled PET bottles. Processing these bottles protects the valuable resources of our planet: water use and CO2 emissions are reduced. This greatly reduces unnecessary strains on the environment during the manufacturing process. Compared to traditional production methods, waste water is reduced by 20%, energy use by 50%, and harmful emissions by 60%."
