Alnatura is not only a food brand, sold in various markets in Germany (e.g. DM, tegut, HIT, AEZ, Globus) but also a food store chain itself with a variety of different products from fruits to textiles. All products have the 'European organic' seal and some are also certified as fairtrade.

Alnatura products can also be bought in Luxemburg ("Cactus Markets") and Switzerland (in ZÃ¼rich in cooperation with Migros). They are not yet sold online.
