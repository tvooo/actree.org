Restrap makes products for cyclists, from recycled and locally sourced materials.

*"We know what cyclists want, understand those small but irritating riding problems  - storage space, fluid intake, reliability - and we solve them with careful, functional designs. 
The environment is a key concern in all we do. Most of our products are still handmade in Yorkshire from recycled, locally sourced materials and always will be.  Everything with the Restrap name on is both ethically and environmentally friendly whilst offering unsurpassed value for money and we remain proud of our Yorkshire roots which got us where we are today."* ([Restrap](http://restrap.co.uk/shop/about_us))
