Lunge is a small privately owned company producing runners and orthopedic shoes.
Most of the materials are produced by handpicked German suppliers and the design, development and manufacturing of the shoes take place in Germany under the consideration of social and sustainable aspects.

Not only the taken responsibility is outstanding but also the quality and design are convincing.

The company homepage is German and they do not ship international up to now.
