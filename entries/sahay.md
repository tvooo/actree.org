SahaY is a social business with the aim to empower women in India, who often live in poverty. The women are paid a fair living wage and have finally the chance to become independent and respected. In the training centre they receive an apprenticeship free of charge and the admission to school for their kids.

SahaY delivers to the European countries after prior consultation. (info@sahay.de)
