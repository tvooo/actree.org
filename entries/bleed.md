Granted, it´s not quite easy to describe bleed with just one sentence.
bleed stands for sportive, organically produced and fair traded textiles!
But it´s the combination, which makes bleed as unique as it can be. Check these brand facts:

bleed represents ...

- our "bleeding" nature, being exploited by the humans for decades
- fair traded, organic streetwear, which also is capable of sportive activities due to functional recycling- & natural fibres
- effective Sympatex sportswear from recycled PET-bottles
- the only German skate brand with exclusively sustainable clothing
- the replacement for the dusty item "eco"
