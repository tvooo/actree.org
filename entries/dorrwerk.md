DÖRRWERK makes eatable fruit paper out of 100% old, second quality fruits, which would be discarded otherwise. Often fruits are still good enough for eating but thrown away because of their look. 
For this project old fruits are rescued and slowly desiccated for hours to make delicious fruit paper.
