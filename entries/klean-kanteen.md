The bottles, cups and food containers of Klean Kanteen are made of stainless steel, without the use of toxin, plastic or aluminium. They are healthy and safe, easy to clean and eco-friendly companions for travelling or everyday life.

From the website:

*"The Original" Steel Bottle. In 2004, Klean KanteenÂ® introduced the first hydration bottle made from stainless steel to give people a safe, healthy alternative to plastic. Our commitment to you and the planet drives everything we do. From our stainless steel creations to the company we keep, we are firmly fixed on the task of making healthy, high-quality goods that will faithfully replace a lifetime of single-use items.*
