Coffee Circle is a unique company from Berlin supporting traditional and sustainable coffee cultivation in Ethiopia. The  coffee farmers are paid more than fairly for their work and supported beyond that. The result is amazing: high quality coffee, grown in Ethiopia and roasted in Hamburg.

"Coffee Circle stands for great coffee and high social impact. By sourcing, roasting and selling some of the most unique coffees of the world, we serve the needs of Coffee Farmers by sharing profits and investing them into community projects. The principles of social responsibility and personal trade are united in our business model."

To date the website is only available in German.
