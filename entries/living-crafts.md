"We pay close attention to fair working conditions at our production sites; we avoid the use of pesticides and chemical additives for growing and processing our raw materials. Thatâ€™s also the reason for choosing equipment which is operated thermo-mechanically only. Hence, we choose eco-friendly, poison-free colours for our fabrics and make sure that we reduce the environmental impact when transporting our goods.

Our products are based on experience, trust and competence. We are not interested in fleetingness. Our designs are timeless as LIVING CRAFTS epitomises consistency. We want to pass on to our clients the things we have learned over the years in business.

To us, our ecological persuasion is more than a business close to nature."
