"Sustainability in fashion industry should be inseparable part of the whole production process. Unfortunately the globalization of clothing production has given us the false presumption that clothes can be produced as fast and with such low prices as we have nowadays become accustomed to...

...At Nurmi we tackle this problem as a whole: We want to do our part in transforming the fashion industry towards a sustainable future. For us sustainability means quality, long-lasting design, ecological materials, transparent production process, ethical working conditions and most of all, designing clothes that you will cherish forever."
