Pumpipumpe advocates a conscious handling with consumer goods and encourages social interactions between neighbours. The borrowing of things, especially those one uses rarely, is stimulated. 

The aim of the project 'Pumpipumpe' is to make neighbours and their offered items visible to encourage the collective usage of goods. Small stickers on the mail box, where people always pass by, will help to show helpfull people to their neighbours.
