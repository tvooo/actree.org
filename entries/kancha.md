KANCHA wraps Kyrgyz craftsmanship around your mobile gadget. Their designed sleeves for notebooks, tablets and smartphones are made by hand and under fair conditions from natural felt and leather. Every sleeve comes with a handwritten name tag, which allows you to learn more about the person behind your product. Thereby KANCHA connects the nomadic tradition with mobile metropolitans and supports the economic development of Kyrgyzstan.
