"share4friends.com is a social network of members that believe in the sharing economy movement. We are convinced that by sharing what we already have — like homes, time, cars, tools and food — everyone benefits from all participants."

You can use share4friends for
* Sharing
* Giving away for free
* Exchanging

The most interessting part about share4friends is the possibility of creating public and private "circles". Thereby you can open a space for your neighbours and you to exchange things 'invisible' for others.
