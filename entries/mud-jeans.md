Doesn’t everybody have a long forgotten jeans lying around somewhere in a closet? Jeans you don’t wear anymore and thus throw away somewhere soon. Did you know that the production of that discarded jeans has cost 8.000 liters of water? And it may have been manufactured in a factory with poor working conditions.

In the Netherlands alone 135 million kilo of clothing is dumped as waste and burned annually... We knew we could do better than that. And not just by producing fashion with organic materials at Fairtrade companies. We go a step further, we use recycled materials for each piece in our collection. 

JOIN THE MUD GENERATION. LEASE A JEANS!
