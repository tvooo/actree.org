Cintinus is searching for the most efficient way of re-using electronical equipment after they have been disused by companies. They obtain the hardware from Swiss companies and guarantee that all devices find their way back into regular usage. Old or damaged devices are primarily used as replacement parts for others.

Parts which cannot be re-used are recycled by certified Swiss companies.

5% of all obtained devices are given to social and charitable institutions.
